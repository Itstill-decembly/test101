                    League of Legends , commonly referred to as League, is a multiplayer online battle arena
                    video game developed and published by Riot Games. League has been free-to-play and is monetized
                    through purchasable character
                    customization.

                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying
                    and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, with unique
                    abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become
                    more powerful In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the
                    enemybase and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.
